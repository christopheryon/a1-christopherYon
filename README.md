## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the p, li, and a selectors...
- **Added a simple JavaScript animation to the page**: I used JavaScript to make the image fade in when the page loads. To achieve this, I defined the base opacity of the image container to be 0, then embedded a script in the HTML that retrieves the image container by its ID, defines a function that uses an interval to repeatedly increase the opacity until it reaches 100%, then immediately runs that function so the image fades in when the page is loaded. While not necessarily an animation, the embedded script also randomly chooses from several greetings to put inside the footer each time the page is loaded.

## Design Achievements
- **Used the Playfair Display and Ubuntu fonts from Google Fonts**: I used Ubuntu as the font for all text on my site except for the header, which uses Playfair Display.
